                <h2> A brief history</h2>
                <p>Established under Greg Ginn
                    Black Flag was originally known as Panic!
                    Today, Black flag is seen as instrumental in 
                    the creation and growth of the  
                    hardcore punk genre. They changed their name to Black Flag
                    after Henry Rollins jumped on stage and began singing</p>
